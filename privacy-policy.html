          Alfarex automatically collects non-personally-identifying information

          such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
          the date and time of each visitor request. Alfarex&#x27;s purpose in
          collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
          understand how Alfarex&#x27;s visitors use its website. From time to
          time, Alfarex may release non-personally-identifying information in

          provide a name and email address.
